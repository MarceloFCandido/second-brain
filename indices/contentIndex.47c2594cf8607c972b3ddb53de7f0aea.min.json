It was followed by the 70's telephone systems hackers, that aimed to get free phone calling. At this time, computers were only owned by military, research and big business fields, without Internet. In the 80's, [computers](notes/hosts.md) became more common and [cyber crime](notes/cyber-crime.md) began. The U.S. government responded with the [U.S Computer Fraud and Abuse Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/99th-congress/house-bill/4718). \n\nIn the 90's and 2000's, the [Internet](notes/internet.md) became common and so the cyber attacks, resulting in criminals being arrested, fined and/or condemned to social services. Enterprises became concerned about their systems and started to hire people that would protect them: ethical hackers. Some of them were ex-cyber criminals that began to do services for these companies.\n\n## Areas\n### Vulnerability Management\nFor a system to be invaded it has to have an advantageous weakness and it has to be interactive. Those weaknesses are vulnerabilities and they need to be [managed](notes/vulnerability-management.md). I.e. you need to know the vulnerabilities of your system/application and respond to them. But, if a system has no weaknesses, i. e. it has no [attack surface](notes/attack-surface.md), it cannot be hacked.\n\n## references\n","lastmodified":"2022-07-20T22:48:11.576886906Z","tags":null},"/notes/exploiting":{"title":"","content":"","lastmodified":"2022-07-20T22:48:11.576886906Z","tags":null},"/notes/fault-tolerance":{"title":"fault-tolerance","content":"\nThe fault tolerance property consists of computer systems reducing fault impacts on itself by responding to adverse conditions, frequently resolving it.\n\n## references\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-07-20T22:48:11.576886906Z","tags":null},"/notes/fibre-channel":{"title":"","content":"","lastmodified":"2022-07-20T22:48:11.576886906Z","tags":null},"/notes/hacker":{"title":"","content":"","lastmodified":"2022-07-20T22:48:11.576886906Z","tags":null},"/notes/hosts":{"title":"hosts","content":"\nAlthough the word *host* is used today for referring to any network device, in the context of [comptia-network-plus](notes/comptia-network-plus.md) it is defined as any network device **with an [ip-address](notes/ip-address.md)**.\n\n## references\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-07-20T22:48:11.576886906Z","tags":null},"/notes/hub":{"title":"","content":"","lastmodified":"2022-07-20T22:48:11.576886906Z","tags":null},"/notes/hub_and_spoke-topology":{"title":"hub_and_spoke-topology","content":"\nThe hub-and-spoke topology, also knows as star topology, consists of the devices of the network being connected through a central point (which can be a hub, an access point, etc). \n\nAlthough it uses more cabling than [bus-topology](notes/bus-topology.md), for example, being more expensive, it allows easier troubleshooting and more [fault-tolerance](notes/fault-tolerance.md), as the devices in the network use separate cables to connect to the central point.

For accomplishing it, professionals have three options:\n1. try to learn a lot of things, resulting in a wide but shallow knowledge;\n2. focus on one thing, becoming an expert in it;\n3. developing a [learning methodology](notes/learning-methodologies.md), knowing how to research, learn fast and how to adapt the knowledge to the current work environment. It involves **finding**, **choosing** and **adapting** the information needed.\n\nConsidering this, the *hacker way of thinking* consists of thinking *outside the box*. It involves understanding that the problems to be resolved doesn't always have boundaries we think they have and, in this case, we can think and learn to resolve the problem in \"unusual\"  ways, freely.\n\nAlso, this learning process does not consist only of theory and practice, but also of [**emotional state**](notes/emotional-inteligence.md). This depends of the **viewpoint about a situation** that the professional is going through. Frustration and confusion disturb the capacity of resolving the situation (here, a problem), but good feeling and confidence help to solve it.\n\nFinally, and again, it is also important that you set a goal when learning infosec.

For automated testing there are softwares like [Nessus](https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus), [Saint](https://www.carson-saint.com), [Qualys](https://www.qualys.com/apps/vulnerability-management-detection-response/) and [Burp](https://portswigger.net/burp).

However, it is important to note that the Internet is a distributed example. There are also the centralized WANs, where remote devices connect to a central local computer, as in a main corporate office that receives connections from remote offices.\n\nAlso, it is important to note that one of the most popular protocols used in WAN is [multiprotocol-label-switching](notes/multiprotocol-label-switching.md) (MPLS). \n\n## references\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-07-20T22:48:11.580886915Z","tags":null},"/notes/wireless-hub_and_spoke-topology":{"title":"","content":"","lastmodified":"2022-07-20T22:48:11.580886915Z","tags":null},"/notes/workgroups":{"title":"workgroups","content":"\nIn a [local-area-network](notes/local-area-network.md), workgroups are \"small logical zones\" where computers are physically connected to the same network segment.\n\n## references\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-07-20T22:48:11.580886915Z","tags":null},"/notes/workstations":{"title":"workstations","content":"\nPowerful computer with more than one CPU available for end users in a network.
