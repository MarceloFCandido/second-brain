These architectures differ from each other by logical arrangement and functioning. Some types of architectures are [peer-to-peer](notes/peer-to-peer.md) and [client-server](notes/client-server.md). These architectures can be blended and, if the blend is well-designed, it can take the best of each one.\n\n### Physical\nThe architectures presented can be defined as the logical topologies of networks, which define how data flows in it. Another possible difference between computer networks are the [physical-topologies](notes/physical-topologies.md). These types of topologies are used together, usually in a similar way, but it can be also very different from each other.

For accomplishing it, professionals have three options:\n1. try to learn a lot of things, resulting in a wide but shallow knowledge;\n2. focus on one thing, becoming an expert in it;\n3. developing a [learning methodology](notes/learning-methodologies.md), knowing how to research, learn fast and how to adapt the knowledge to the current work environment.

It involves understanding that the problems to be resolved doesn't always have boundaries we think they have and, in this case, we can think and learn to resolve the problem in \"unusual\"  ways, freely.\n\nAlso, this learning process does not consist only of theory and practice, but also of [**emotional state**](notes/emotional-inteligence.md). This depends of the **viewpoint about a situation** that the professional is going through.
