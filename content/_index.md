title: Marcelo's Second Brain ðŸ§ 
---

Hi, I'm [Marcelo Ferreira CÃ¢ndido](notes/about_me.md), and it's my second brain.
While I'm studying, I like to take notes using some kind of [Zettelkasten method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten).
So, I decided to publish it as I study.

# Maps of Concepts
Here you can find the maps of concepts that link all of my notes.
