A policy template defines how a [vulnerability scan](notes/vulnerability-scan) must be run by the software, when it should happen and which tests should be used. A policy can be build by the vendor (default) or the user (customized version of default ones), being the last the most used. Also, it can have the option of using credentials, for testing as a privileged user.
