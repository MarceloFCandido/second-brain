The peer-to-peer (P2P) network architecture consists in a number of computers connected to each other, each one with the possibility to act as client/server to the others. A [local-area-network](notes/local-area-network.md) (LAN) is an example of a peer-to-peer network, as there are no central servers and each machine in the network is equal. This type of network works well if:
- the number of users is limited and not large;
- users store backups locally;
- the security requirements are low.

Considering this definition, it is valid to say that there is no central authority in this network. So, each computer is responsible to the security of its resources.
