The process of [vulnerability](notes/vulnerability.md) management has the objective of reducing the [attack surface](notes/attack-surface.md), mitigating risks. For doing that, three factors must be managed: vulnerabilities, [exploits](notes/exploiting.md) and [points of interaction](notes/points-of-interaction.md). 

In practice, this process consists of [discovering the assets](notes/asset-discovering.md) of a company and [scanning](notes/vulnerability-scan.md) them for vulnerabilities. It is followed by scoring for [prioritization](notes/vulnerability-prioritization.md) and [responding](notes/vulnerability-response.md) the vulnerabilities found, avoiding [false positives](notes/vulnerabilities-false-positives.md).
