## Definition
Basically, a computer network is the connection of two or more computers in a way they can share resources, Internet connection and devices. 

## Types
There are various types of computer networks. These types generally differentiate from each other by geographic arrangement. They are:
- [local-area-network](notes/local-area-network.md);
- [metropolitan-area-network](notes/metropolitan-area-network.md);
- [wide-area-network](notes/wide-area-network.md);
- personal area network;
- campus area network;
- [storage-area-network](notes/storage-area-network.md) and
- [[software_defined-wide-area-network]].

## Architectures
### Logical
But computer networks can also differentiate from others by its architecture. These architectures differ from each other by logical arrangement and functioning. Some types of architectures are [peer-to-peer](notes/peer-to-peer.md) and [client-server](notes/client-server.md). These architectures can be blended and, if the blend is well-designed, it can take the best of each one.

### Physical
The architectures presented can be defined as the logical topologies of networks, which define how data flows in it.Another possible difference between computer networks are theÂ [physical-topologies](notes/physical-topologies). These types of topologies are used together, usually in a similar way, but it can be also very different from each other. Some examples of physical topologies are:
* [bus](notes/bus-topology.md);
* [hub-and-spoke](notes/hub_and_spoke-topology.md);
* [ring](notes/ring-topology.md);
* [mesh](notes/mesh-topology.md);
* [point-to-point](notes/point_to_point-topology.md);
* [point-to-multipoint](notes/point_to_multipoint-topology.md);
* [hybrid](notes/hybrid-topology.md);
