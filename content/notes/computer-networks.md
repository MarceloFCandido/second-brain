Basically, a computer network is the connection of two or more computers in a way they can share resources, Internet connection and devices. 


There are various types of computer networks. These types generally differentiate from each other by geographic arrangement. They are:
- [local-area-network](notes/local-area-network.md);
- [metropolitan-area-network](notes/metropolitan-area-network.md);
- [wide-area-network](notes/wide-area-network.md);
- personal area network;
- campus area network;
- [storage-area-network](notes/storage-area-network.md) and
- [[software_defined-wide-area-network]].


But computer networks can also differentiate from others by its architecture. These architectures differ from each other by logical arrangement and functioning. Some types of architectures are [peer-to-peer](notes/peer-to-peer.md) and [client-server](notes/client-server.md). These architectures can be blended and, if the blend is well-designed, it can take the best of each one.

The architectures presented can be defined as the logical topologies of networks, which define how data flows in it. Another possible difference between computer networks are the [physical-topologies](notes/physical-topologies.md). These types of topologies are used together, usually in a similar way, but it can be also very different from each other. Some examples of physical topologies are:
- [bus-topology](notes/bus-topology.md);
- [[hub_and_spoke-topology]];
- [ring-topology](notes/ring-topology.md);
- [mesh-topology](notes/mesh-topology.md);
- [[point_to_point-topology]];
- [[point_to_multipoint-topology]] and
- [hybrid-topology](notes/hybrid-topology.md).
