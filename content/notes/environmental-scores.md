The environmental scores of [CVSS](notes/cvss.md) are based on the [base scores](notes/base-scores.md) with three additional parameters:
1. confidentiality requirements;
1. integrity requirements and
1. availability requirements.
The base scores are reevaluated by the perspective of the environment of the company that required the [vulnerabilities](notes/vulnerability.md) assessment and not by the product vendor.

Also, it is important to note that impact and requirements, related to evaluation of the [CIA triad](notes/cia-triad.md), are different. The primer measures the result of possible exploitation. The later how much the assessed company cares about the vulnerability.
