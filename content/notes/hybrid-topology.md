The hybrid topology consists, basically, of the blend of two or more [physical-topologies](notes/physical-topologies.md), being it in the physical layer or in the logical one. For example, in a company you could have a [[point_to_multipoint-topology]] of a router connecting all other [workgroups](notes/workgroups.md) routers and these providing a [[hub_and_spoke-topology]] to the computers connected to them.
