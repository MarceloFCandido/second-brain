When doing a project, in order to be successful in it, you need to be accountable. It is, you need to set some kind of self-charge that help you to accomplish the project. It can be auto-regulating (e.g. a todo list or calendar reminders) or relying on the regulation of others (e.g. teaching some friend what you have already done until now).
