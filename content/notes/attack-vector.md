The attack vector is the way an invader can access a [vulnerability](notes/vulnerability.md) to take on a system. Some vulnerabilities depend on physical access to the vulnerable assets. Some, in other hand, can be accessed remotely. Both access modes would rely in the use of a medium or device. 

The physical attacks can use as vector pendrives or vulnerable computers, for example. Also, for the remote ones, it can be used infected software or unauthorized Internet connection.
