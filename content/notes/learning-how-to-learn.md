In the field of [infosec](notes/infomation-security.md), it is necessary to keep learning and quickly, as [penetration testers](notes/penetration-testing.md) must have wide and deep knowledge in various areas. For accomplishing it, professionals have three options:
1. try to learn a lot of things, resulting in a wide but shallow knowledge;
2. focus on one thing, becoming an expert in it;
3. developing a [learning methodology](notes/learning-methodology.md), knowing how to research, learn fast and how to adapt the knowledge to the current work environment. It involves **finding**, **choosing** and **adapting** the information needed.

Considering this, the *hacker way of thinking* consists of *thinking outside the box*. It involves understanding that the problems to be resolved doesn't always have boundaries we think they have and, in this case, we can think and learn to resolve the problem in "unusual"  ways, freely.

Also, this learning process doesn't consist only of theory and practice, but also of **emotional state**. This depends of the **viewpoint about a situation** that the professional is going through. Frustration and confusion get in the way of resolving the situation (here, a problem), but good feeling and confidence help to solve it.
