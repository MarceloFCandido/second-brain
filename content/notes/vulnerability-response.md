After the [vulnerabilities](notes/vulnerability.md) are [found](notes/vulnerability-scan.md) and [prioritized](notes/vulnerability-prioritization.md), they must be addressed. Governance, Compliance, System Engineering and Management teams will decide what to do with them and [ethical hackers](notes/ethical-hacking.md) may be required to document the decision. The plan for this decision must comprise questions like:
* should the vulnerability be retested?
* should it be fixed?
* should the company accept the risk and let it?
