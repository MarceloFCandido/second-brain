After the vulnerabilities are [found](notes/vulnerability-scan.md) and [prioritized](notes/vulnerability-prioritization.md), they must be addressed. Governance, Compliance, System Engineering and Management teams will decide if the risk presented by them must be eased or accepted. [Ethical hackers](notes/ethical-hacking.md) may be required to document the decision.
