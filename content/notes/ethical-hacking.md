## Definition
An ethical [hacker](notes/hacker.md) is someone contracted for testing some system, finding its [vulnerabilities](notes/vulnerability.md) and helping turn it more secure. The bad use of these vulnerabilities could affect [shareholders](notes/shareholders.md), managers, employees, customers, suppliers and competitors (as a [data breach](notes/data-breaches.md) can disrupt a [market's ecosystem](notes/market-ecosystem.md)).

## Some History
Ethical Hacking field began in 1961, with MIT researchers hacking a train toy. It was followed by the 70's telephone systems hackers, that aimed to get free phone calling. At this time, computers were only owned by military, research and big business fields, without Internet. In the 80's, [computers](notes/hosts.md) became more common and [cyber crime](notes/cyber-crime.md) began. The U.S. government responded with the [U.S Computer Fraud and Abuse Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/99th-congress/house-bill/4718). 

In the 90's and 2000's, the [Internet](notes/internet.md) became common and so the cyber attacks, resulting in criminals being arrested, fined and/or condemned to social services. Enterprises became concerned about their systems and started to hire people that would protect them: ethical hackers. Some of them were ex-cyber criminals that began to do services for these companies.

## Responsibilities
### Vulnerability Management
For a system to be invaded it has to have an advantageous weakness and it has to be interactive. Those weaknesses are vulnerabilities and they need to be [managed](notes/vulnerability-management.md). I.e. you need to know the vulnerabilities of your system/application and respond to them. But, if a system has no weaknesses, i. e. it has no [attack surface](notes/attack-surface.md), it cannot be hacked.

### System Auditing
After collecting vulnerabilities by [automated scanning](notes/vulnerability-scan.md), as there are [false positives](notes/false-positive.md) and [negatives](notes/false-negative.md), the ethical hacker must test manually the system/application for validating it. It is called [system auditing](notes/system-auditing.md).
