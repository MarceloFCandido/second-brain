The bus topology consist of connecting the devices of a computer network to a terminated central cable. In this way, all devices are capable of see all the data transmitted trough the cable, but only the recipients of each piece of data will receive it.

As advantages above other topologies, it is cheaper and easy to install. As disadvantages, it is hard to solve problems (troubleshooting) on it and reallocate it. Also, it doesn't provide enough [fault-tolerance](notes/fault-tolerance.md), so any problems in the bus cable and the network goes down.
