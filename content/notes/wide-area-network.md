As the name suggests, a Wide Area Network (WAN) is a type of network that covers a larger geographic space. Because of its size, it is slower than [local-area-network](notes/local-area-network.md) and the hosts can choose to be disconnected from it (while in LANs they are either connected to it or not).

An example of WAN is the Internet, which is the internetwork of various intranetworks (LANs) around the globe. However, it is important to note that the Internet is a distributed example. There are also the centralized WANs, where remote devices connect to a central local computer, as in a main corporate office that receives connections from remote offices.

Also, it is important to note that one of the most popular protocols used in WAN is [multiprotocol-label-switching](notes/multiprotocol-label-switching.md) (MPLS).
