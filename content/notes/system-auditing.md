An audition of a system consists of a suite of tests done manually by the [ethical hacker](notes/ethical-hacking.md) for validating [vulnerabilities](notes/vulnerability.md) (which may have been found by [vulnerability scanning](notes/vulnerability-scan.md)). It is needed because of [false positives](notes/false-positive.md) and [negatives](notes/false-negative.md).

This suite of tests relay on a [scope](notes/test-scope.md), information gathered from the system to be audited, vulnerability and [exploit](notes/exploit.md) research, and exploit execution. At the end, the ethical hacker write a report about what was found. It can also be said by the means for a general methodology consisting of four phases:
1. [reconnaissance](notes/audition-reconnaissance.md);
2. [research](notes/audition-research.md);
3. [validation](notes/audition-validation.md); and
4. [reporting](notes/audition-reporting.md).
