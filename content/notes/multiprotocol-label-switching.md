Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) is a popular protocol used in [wide-area-network](notes/wide-area-network.md). It assigns labels to data that will be sent to the MPLS network (cloud). In the cloud, instead of using physical links, the data can be forwarded using virtual ones. This provides some flexibility to the network, redundancy and one-to-many connections, alongside with the possibility of prioritizing some types of data above others.
