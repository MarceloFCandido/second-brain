As enterprises are restricted by its resources as time and money, tasks must be prioritized. It also happens with [vulnerabilities](notes/vulnerability.md). They must be [scored and rated](notes/cvss.md), being next addressed in function of it, by the [ethical hacker](notes/ethical-hacking.md). It is done in two steps:
1. [scanning](notes/vulnerability-scan.md) and [reporting](notes/vulnerability-report.md);
2. management: it consists of confirming that each vulnerability exists, rating each of those that really exist, measure the effort needed to fix each one and take an [action plan](notes/vulnerability-remediation-plan.md).

The data to be used by the prioritization step should, ideally, be in only one workspace/central database. It is where the vulnerabilities are closed, tests redone and the risk is evaluated.
