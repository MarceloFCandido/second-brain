The base scores from [CVSS](notes/cvss.md) are based on the view of the product vendor (who may made the product) about the [vulnerabilities](notes/vulnerability.md). It takes eight parameters:
1. [attack vector](notes/attack-vector.md);
3. [attack complexity](notes/attack-complexity.md);
4. [privileges required](notes/system-privileges.md);
5. [user interaction](notes/user-interaction.md);
6. [scope](notes/attack-scope.md);
7. confidentiality impact;
8. integrity impact and
9. availability impact,
being the later three related to the [CIA triad](notes/cia-triad.md).
