Being the opposite of [peer-to-peer](notes/peer-to-peer.md), the Client-Server network architecture consists of a **server** that manages all resources (and the access to them) in the network and the **client** that tries to access the resources from the first.

This type of architecture allows some advantages:
- better organization, as resources are accessible only thought server;
- better security, as the credentials are centralized in one machine;
- scalability, as servers can get a lot of workstations connected to them.
