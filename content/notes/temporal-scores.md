The temporal scores of [CVSS](notes/cvss.md) are based in the information available on the time of the scoring. It consists of three scores:
1. exploit code maturity, or how ready are the exploit codes available to do successful attacks;
2. remediation level, or which actions can be taken now to help against the exploit of the [vulnerability](notes/vulnerability.md), and
3. report confidence, or how much trust can be put in the reporter of the vulnerability and if it have been confirmed.
