It is the third phase of [system auditing](notes/system-auditing.md), consisting of trying to execute the [exploits](notes/exploits.md) that were found in the [previous phase](notes/audition-research.md). Those can need some modification to work. If no exploits were found for a given [vulnerability](notes/vulnerability.md), this phase can be ignored for this case.
