In a [system audition](notes/system-auditing.md), after [gathering information](notes/audition-reconnaissance.md) about the system, as the [ethical hacker](notes/ethical-hacking) knows the [vulnerabilities](notes/vulnerability.md) of the [scope](notes/test-scope.md), the professional must find the [exploits](notes/exploit.md) for which of those are viable on the investigated systems (as not every vulnerability found is exploitable).
