 Setting goals for learning is the difference between getting to where you want to be or not. It is because, knowing your goal, you can overcome the obstacles in the path for it. 
 
 For doing this, you can choose between [short-term goals](notes/short_term-goals.md) and [long-term goals](notes/long_term-goals.md), being the former the building blocks of the later. Together, they will form your [incremental plan](notes/incremental-plan.md) to your main goal. I. e. for accomplishing your main goal, focus in short-term goals.
