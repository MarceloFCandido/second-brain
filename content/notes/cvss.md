The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is a tool designed to help enterprises to [prioritize](notes/vulnerability-prioritization.md) its [vulnerabilities](notes/vulnerability.md). It uses subjective perception avoiding biases by requiring objective features. It works with three sets of scores: [base](notes/base-scores.md), [temporal](notes/temporal-scores.md) and [environmental](notes/environmental-scores.md).
