The vulnerability scan consists of searching for weaknesses in some resource/service, generally, by automated and manual ways. The results are [reported](notes/vulnerability-report.md) by an [ethical hacker](notes/ethical-hacking.md).

Manual tests are superior to automated ones because they are more accurate. But the later can proportionate a start for deeper manual testing. For automated testing there are softwares like [Nessus](https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus), [Saint](https://www.carson-saint.com), [Qualys](https://www.qualys.com/apps/vulnerability-management-detection-response/) and [Burp](https://portswigger.net/burp). They have a similar basic functioning, consisting of two steps:
1. configure a [policy template](notes/policy-template.md);
2. use it to configure a scan.

When configuring a scan, you need to provide some information for the software, as the [IP address](notes/ip-address.md) of the target machine, the [URL](notes/url.md) (if it's a [web application](notes/web-application.md)), schedule (always trying to avoid [network congestion](notes/network-congestion.md)), etc.
