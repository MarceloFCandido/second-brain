Local Area Network (LAN) is a type of computer network restricted geographically by a location as a house, a building or a school. It is recommended to divide it in [workgroups](notes/workgroups.md).

The connection between devices in a LAN can be done with devices as the [hub](notes/hub.md) and the [switch](notes/switch.md). Also, LANs can be connected directly, but it would remove the logical division proposed by workgroups, resulting in one bigger LAN. For preserving this feature, a [router](notes/router.md) can be used to connect them. For someone in a LAN to connect to someone in another LAN it is used a logical address ([ip-address](notes/ip-address.md)). Also, using routers besides direct connection allow LANs users to get faster responses and let administration easier.

The most common devices in LANs are:
- [workstations](notes/workstations.md);
- [servers](notes/servers.md) and
- [hosts](notes/hosts.md).
