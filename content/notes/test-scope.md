Tests, if not performed properly, can be as dangerous as real attacks;
The test scope limits your actuation on the system audition, limiting the risk of the test, although also its efficacy.
The document that gives the test scope can be divided in three parts:
	summary;
	work breakdown sheet;
	rules for assessment
