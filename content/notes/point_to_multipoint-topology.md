The point-to-multipoint topology consists of, basically, a relation of one endpoint (that can be a [router](notes/router.md), [hub](notes/hub.md), [switch](notes/switch.md), antenna, etc) to $n$ other endpoints. For example, the routers of $n$ companies connected to a regional router of a [isp](notes/isp.md).
